This is my 1st and 2nd batch OS! I hope you enjoy useing these batch operating systems and make sure to change the batch file every month to get the most recent update! (working on update system)
If you see a BSOD that means that app is not done. No actual error handleing has been made (yet) so please be patient. I will put the update log down here becouse i honestly do not know what to put here lol
Change log:
v0.1
Release of the batch OSes! Hope you enjoy!
